Data and scripts associated with the paper: *Sponges, ctenophores and the statistical significance of syntenies*

The program `rhduet.py` will do the analysis, on the data in the `bed` and `all_vs_all` (orthologs) directories.

It will run as is for a comparison of *Capsaspora*, *Hormiphora*, *Ephydatia* and *Rhopilema*
